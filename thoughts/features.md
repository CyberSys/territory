DONE:
- Animation Pipeline
- Keep rotation when loading new chunks
- Shadow Mapping!!!!
- Save World File Structure / File Folder Structure
- World generates and saves to file
- World loads chunks around a player
- Arbitrary world sizes!
-> PLAYER POSITION AND CHUNK LOADING
- Chunks have a position in chunk-space
- Some chunks are loaded, some are not, and which ones are depends on the player position
- If chunks are loaded, they are simply rendered at appropriate position relative to the player
- World can save and load chunks into an array
- Chunks are rendered as single objects
- Chunks have normal maps and we can compute simple shading
- Colors for chunk faces are loaded dynamically
- Setup Basic Shadow Mapping and Normal Mapping / Ambient Lighting, etc.
- Chunks should construct a VBO, so that we render chunks, not individual cubes.
- Pick the block color based on the ID value in the chunk data.
- and more...
