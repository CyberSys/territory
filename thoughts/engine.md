A number of engine improvements need to be made, and there are options I haven't explored yet.








I want: Better Meshing for faster rendering times (i.e. less fragments to process every single frame, ideally MANY LESS)

and: I want to see if I can get the DOF shader to slightly make the map that we can see see-through in a visually appealing way, so that we can still see stuff behind a certain area.

This is more difficult. Maybe the camera should just be angled up more. lmao.

I'll have to see. Right now this visibility issue is a problem, but might even not be in the future. Who knows.

Maybe only if it is shaded and behind the mid-point (i.e. the depth value at wherever the camera is?)

I'll have to see what works well.
But first I need better meshing so everything is simply FASTER
and I don't have these rendering bottlenecks.

The renderer needs to be made FASTER.
Work on this!


Also still need: Bloom effects,

Remove the chunk border drawing. That looks pretty sick then.
